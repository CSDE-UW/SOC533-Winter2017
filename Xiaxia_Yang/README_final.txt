Final Project-Dependency ratio of China

  My original data comes from the UN population division and the World Health Organization.
  The calculation steps and the resulting line charts are showed in the Presentation_final.pptx file. The calculation procedures and periodical results are showed in the Worksheets_final.xlsx file.
  The first line chart in the .pptx file is based on actual observed data. We can see that China's dependency ratio used to have similiar quantity and follow the same trend as other less developed countries from the 1950s until the 1970s. However starting from the 1980s, its dependency ratio begins to approximate that of the more developed countries and becomes even lower than that of the more developed countries after 1995. We can guess that part of the reason of the decrease of total dependency ratio is the implement of the one-child policy which significantly restricts new births. We also find that in the most recent 15 years, the total dependency ratio is increasing.
  The second line chart in the .pptx file is based on adjusted data with stable age pyramids using Lotka's R. The sense of computing dependency ratio with stable age pyramids is that when compared with observed ratios, the ratios calculated in the context of stable population get rid of the effect of migration and prior history. Therefore it shows the intrinsic character of the population. From the chart we can see that from 2000 to 2015, the change of child dependency ratio of China is negligible, while the elderly dependency ratio is on the rise, leading to the increase of the total dependency ratio. We may conclude that it is the elderly that contributes to the recent increase of total dependency ratio. Additionally it could be concluded that while the new births are severely controlled, the proportion of the elderly is growing. Thus the population aging issue comes into being in recent years. 
  The results of the first plot and the second plot is sort of different. The second one suggests that from 2000 to 2015, the total dependency ratio continues increasing. While the first one suggests that from 2000 to 2010, the total dependency ratio decreases and from 2010 to 2015, that value increases. Thus after we adjust the dependency ratio with lotka's r, the result changes.
