My data comes from the UN population division and the World Health Organization.
The calculation steps are showed in the Powerpoint file.
The sense of computing dependency ratio with stable age pyramids it that compared with observed ratios, the ratios calculated in the context of stable population get rid of the effect of migration and prior history. It is sort of the intrinsic character of the pop.
