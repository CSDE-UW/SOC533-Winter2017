This is a way to produce the Leslie matrix for Homework 5 using the data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD)
and Human Fertility Database (HFD).

You first download the data from HFD the cohort-level fertility data for Sweden from the website below:
http://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/country.php?country=SWE&tab=asfr

Then, you download a 5x5 lifetable from the HMD for the leslie matrix
http://www.mortality.org/cgi-bin/hmd/country.php?cntr=SWE&level=1

Remember downloading data for 5x5 life table for FEMALE only.

Then, just follow the annotations on my R code, or read my html file, it is simple and easy!
